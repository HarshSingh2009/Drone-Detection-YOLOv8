# Drone-Detection-YOLOv8
My First Object Detection Project!!. Detects if Drone is visible in an image or a video

In this Project, I have used a YOLOv8 nano model (https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/) and trained it for 100 epochs on the following dataset: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muki2003/yolo-drone-detection-dataset/data)

**Note: Model developed in this Github repo, cannot detect Drone objects in an image/video that are far away and works the best when objects are nearer**

**Achieving:**
* mAP@50 - 0.85
* map@50-95 - 0.48
